Documentation: World Energy Consumption Dashboard with Streamlit
Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based web application for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing trends in global energy consumption over time. The application provides insights into energy use, renewable energy adoption, and trends across countries and regions. It also includes a machine learning model to classify countries as transitioning to renewable energy or remaining dependent on fossil fuels.

Key Features
Interactive Data Filtering:

Filter by year and country using Streamlit's sidebar.
Display filtered data dynamically in the main interface.
Visualization of Energy Trends:

Global Trends: Total energy consumption over time.
Country Trends: Energy consumption trends for user-selected countries.
Regional Trends: Energy consumption trends across major regions.
Top Energy Consumers:

Visualize the top 10 energy-consuming countries for a selected year.
Transition Analysis:

Simulated data shows renewable energy adoption.
Binary classification of countries into "Transitioning" or "Not Transitioning" based on renewable energy use.
Machine Learning Model:

Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a country is transitioning to renewable energy.
Displays the classification report, confusion matrix, and feature importance.
Transition Trends Over Time:

Plots the percentage of countries transitioning to renewable energy over time.
Code Structure
Data Loading and Preparation

The load_data function fetches and processes the dataset from a CSV file hosted on GitHub.
Data reshaping and cleaning:
Converts years and energy consumption to numeric values.
Adds synthetic renewable energy data for simulation purposes.
Calculates the percentage of renewable energy use and binary classification for transition status.
User Interface

Built with Streamlit components (st.title, st.write, st.checkbox, st.slider, etc.).
Sidebar for filtering data by year and country.
Visualizations

matplotlib is used for all charts:
Line plots for trends.
Bar charts for top energy consumers.
Machine Learning Model

Uses scikit-learn for training a Random Forest Classifier:
Features: Year, Energy Consumption, Renewable Percentage.
Target: Binary classification (Transitioning).
Splits data into training and testing sets for evaluation.
How to Use the Application
Launch the App:

Run the script in your terminal or Jupyter environment:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Replace app.py with the name of your script.
Navigate the Dashboard:

Explore trends and insights using sidebar filters and interactive checkboxes.
Visualize energy consumption trends and top consumers.
Train Machine Learning Model:

Click the "Train Model" button to train a classification model and view its performance.
Analyze Transition Trends:

Enable the "Show Transition Trends" checkbox to explore global renewable energy adoption over time.
